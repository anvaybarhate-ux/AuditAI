You are a financial compliance expert for Indian businesses.
Extract the Top 15 most critical GST compliance rules from the comprehensive document below.
Make sure to include a balanced mix of HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW severity rules to provide comprehensive coverage.
Do NOT return more than 15 rules. It is critical that the output array contains exactly 15 or fewer items to ensure fast processing.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No explanation. No markdown fences. Just the array.

Every item in the array must have EXACTLY these fields:
- id         (integer, start from 1, increment by 1)
- description(string, brief name of the rule)
- condition  (string, the specific logic/check for the rule)
- severity   (string, one of: "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW")
- category   (string, e.g. "GST", "ITC", "Fraud", "Invoice", "Filing")
